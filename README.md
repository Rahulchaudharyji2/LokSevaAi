# LokSevaAi

LokSevaAi is an open-source platform leveraging Generative AI and advanced retrieval techniques to revolutionize public service delivery and government processes. The project integrates cutting-edge technologies such as Pinecone DB for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), web scraping pipelines, and WhatsApp bot automation to provide seamless, AI-powered solutions for civic engagement and administration.

## Key Features

- **Generative AI (GenAI):**  
  Uses large language models to automate and enhance interactions, data analysis, and service delivery.

- **Pinecone DB & RAG:**  
  Employs Pinecone vector database for efficient semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation, enabling the system to answer queries based on vast document stores and knowledge bases.

- **Web Scraping Pipelines:**  
  Automatically extracts and updates relevant data from government and public service websites for up-to-date information and insights.

- **WhatsApp Bot with Authentication:**  
  Provides an AI-powered conversational interface via WhatsApp, enabling easy access to services, FAQs, and real-time support for citizens.
  - User authentication is handled via WhatsApp to ensure secure and personalized service delivery.
  - The bot automates responses, answers questions, and guides users through workflows.

## Architecture Overview

- **Backend:** Node.js / Python (modify as per your stack)
- **AI Models:** OpenAI / custom GenAI models
- **Database:** Pinecone DB (vector storage for RAG)
- **Web Scraping:** Scrapy / BeautifulSoup / Puppeteer
- **Messaging & Auth:** WhatsApp Business API with integrated authentication
